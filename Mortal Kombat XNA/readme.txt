Coded from scratch, this is my attempt of making a clone of the original Mortal Kombat with the added functionality of Kinect voice and audio controls. The game is controlled using an Xbox 360 control pad and the Kinect can be used to move the characters left and right by leaning in the respective direction. Voice controls such as "Pause", "Restart", "Exit" and "Restart" can be used to control the games menu system.

Controls:

2 Player Game.

X - Punch
Y - Kick
A - Duck
B - Block

Left Thumbstick - Left and Right
