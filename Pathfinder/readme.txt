This program was created using XNA and Monogame to create a simple testing environment and then implement several pathfind algorithms to comapre then against one another. 

CONTROLS

- W,A,S,D: MOVES THE PLAYER UP, DOWN LEFT RIGHT.
- 1: ASTAR
	- E: EUCLIDIAN HEURISTIC.
	- R: DIAGONAL HEURISTIC.
	- T: MANHATTEN HEURISTIC (DEFAULT).
- 2: DIJKSTRA.
- 3: SCENTMAP.
- 4: UNOPTOMISED ASTAR.
	- E: EUCLIDIAN HEURISTIC.
	- R: DIAGONAL HEURISTIC.
	- T: MANHATTEN HEURISTIC (DEFAULT).

IF YOU MOVE THE PLAYER DURING THE BOTS MOVEMENT, BE SURE TO RE-PRESS THE DESIRED ALGORITHM TO RECALCULATE THE PATH!

BE SURE TO ALLOW EACH ALGORITHM TO REACH THE PLAYER IN ORDER TO RECORD "TIME TAKEN" DATA TO THE TEXT FILE!

AFTER EACH ALGORITHM HAS BEEN RUN, BE SURE TO PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY TO EXIT THE PROGRAM!
THIS WILL CLOSE THE TEXT FILES AND SAVE DATA TO THEM!

THE DATA IS INCLUDED WITHIN THE "PATHFINDER" FOLDER IN A FOLDER CALLED "ANALYSIS DATA".
