This game was made during the University of Lincoln's 24 hour GameJam. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the level, avoiding the buildings by jumping over them. The level also features 3 different "powerups" thats speed and slow your movement speed and provide you with a health that you can lose by hitting buildings.

While the game mechancics are simple, you have to take into account it was made from scratch in just a few hours. The game uses a persistent level and item spawner in conjunction with a parallaxing background making the technicality of the game more than meets the eye.
